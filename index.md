### What is this?

This is a personal website, made as a personal project that will allow me to store everything from blogs to a collection of interesting links that I recommend looking at.  The website is hosted on Github, a site used by many programmers to track coding changes and allow a sort of "backup as you go" system, to put it in layman's terms.

### Why is the design so bland?

Because designing websites is hard and Squarespace is expensive and doesn't do what I'd want so I ended up pulling somebody else's publically available code to make the website.  As such, my focus was on function first and design later, so I ended up looking a ridiculous amount for a theme I liked that had this sort of sidebar functionality.

### What does the name mean?

Array of Characters actually stands for two things, one of which the programmers who are reading probably already know.  The first is a sort of programmer joke - in programming, one of the most common ways we store data is something called an "array", a sort of list of things (I **know** a list is different, programmers.  Let it slide, it explains it well).  When programmers represent words like the ones you're reading right now, they aren't represented as paragraphs or sentences or words - but rather, as an "array" of characters (characters being letters, numbers, symbols, etc).  Hence the joke is that all of the content on this website is mostly just an "array of characters" in a set of code.

The second meaning is a bit more obscure, but I hope will become more relevant as I continue to write blogs and post links.  For the second meaning, consider characters as instead the word meaning "what makes you, you".  Array of Characters in this context means more the vast amount of qualities and opinions and backgrounds we encounter during our lives, both from other people and our own development as human beings.
